## EX 06
* Notice the difference with the previous exercise. What changed?
  * the `wrapWithTag {}`function has been written as an arrow function that returns a default value
  * the parseTitle function has been removed, and replaced by:
    * `... => document.write(wrapWithTag(movie.toLowerCase(), `li`)));`
